									<h4>About</h4>
									<p>
										As an acknowledgment of our educational privileges at the University of Minnesota, we, a group of students in the arts, aim to use our knowledge and resources here at the university to curate a production - Blueprint. <br/><br/>
										Led by our mission statement “Equitable Artmaking. Inclusive Space. Thoughtful Conversation.”, Blueprint is a non-profit production which functions essentially as a platform to support equitable artmaking by providing an accessible foundation for emerging artists, from their various artistic pursuits (ranging from visual art, film, live music, poetry, dance, and in between), to share their work with a wider audience. <br/><br/>
										With our values of accessibility in mind, the production team has been working hard to strategize fundraising events and donation drives with the hopes of making the event free for all members of the audience.
