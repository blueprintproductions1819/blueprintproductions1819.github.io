								<p>My name is Madelyn Kapheim and I am a sophomore at the University of Minnesota studying art and applying for the BFA program at the U this semester. I spend most of my time in the ceramics studios handbuilding and creating pottery. I find a lot of my inspiration from natural forms such as flowers, plants, trees, animals and humans. I am attracted to the idea of growth, weather that be in plans and animals or my personal growth as an individual i use art as an outlet to express my growth and the way I experience growth around me.  Art has been a huge part of my life for as long as I can remember. From a young age I knew that art was the career path for me, after undergraduate schooling I plan to go onto grad school and eventually be a college professor of art.</p>
